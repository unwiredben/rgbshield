<p>This Arduino-compatible shield uses three TI TLC5940 PWM LED driver
ships to drive a 4x4 array of RGB LEDs.  Each color is controlled by a
different chip so you can adjust the reference resistors for the
appropriate current.  This also includes mounting positions for for
three general-purpose buttons that are connected to ground, and a
reset button.  The TLC5940 chips are not directly connected to any
Arduino pins, but a header is provided for you to make a manual
connection depending on the needs of your sketch.</p>

<p>This board is a version of the circuit used at the first HTINK
workshop on March 14th, 2009 at Bug Labs in New York City.</p>

<p>If you'd like to build one, you can get 
<a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/rgb-led-shield-v14-kit-p-430.html">a full kit from Seeed Studio for $35</a>.</p>

<h2>Programming the RGB LED Shield</h2>

<p>To program your Arduino to control the RGB LED shield, you
first need to install the tlc5490arduino library from <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/tlc5940arduino/">http://code.google.com/p/tlc5940arduino/</a>.
Do this by downloading the ZIP file from the site, unpacking the
TLC5490 folder, and putting it into your Arduino IDE's
hardware/libraries folder.  You'll then need to modify the
tlc_config.h file to change the line</p>

<pre>#define NUM_TLCS    1</pre>

<p>to read</p>

<pre>#define NUM_TLCS    3</pre>

<p>since there are three TLC5490 ICs in this circuit connected in
series.</p>

<p>Here are a few example sketches that will use this library
to make different patterns.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="TLC_wavy.pde">TLC_wavy.pde</a>, Eric Moore
<li><a href="TLC_box_1.pde">TLC_box_1.pde</a>, Ben Combee
<li><a href="TLC_box_2.pde">TLC_box_2.pde</a>, Ben Combee
<li><a href="TLC_arrows2.pde">TLC_arrows2.pde</a>, Ben Combee
</ul>

<p>On the shield, the four LEDs at the corners are labeled with their
X,Y coordinates: "1,1", "1,4", "4,1", and "4,4".  The formula to turn
a coordinate into a LED number is <dfn>(X - 1 + (Y - 1) *
4)</dfn>.</a>

<hr/>

<h2>Version 1.4</h2>

<p>This version has some major changes from the original 1.1 board.

<ul>

<li>Fixed the DCPRG signal.  In the 1.1 shield, this was tied to
GND instead of VCC.  This prevents you from loading dot correction
information into the TLC chips.</li>

<li>Added a 10K resistor between BLANK and VCC.  This pulls up the
BLANK line when the Arduino isn't asserting it, keeping the LEDs from
lighting when there's no control signals (like during reset).</li>

<li>Added a default header parallel to the TLC signal header so you
can just use jumper wires to give the shield a default wiring hookup.
You also can populate this with a 2x8 header and then use plastic
jumpers for this.</li>

<li>Disconnected the power net for the LEDs from the board VCC and
provide a two pin connector to connect them together.  This would
allow running the LEDs at a different voltage if desired.</li>

<li>The GSCLK, BLANK, and XLAT signals are now all hard-wired to Arduino
pins D3, D10, and D9 respectively.  This is because the TLC5940
library uses those pins for their special timer properties, so they
can't be reassigned.</li>

<li>Added an 2x4 output header that allows chaining a second board to
the first one, with all the TLC5940 control pins, power, and ground
provided.</li>

<li>Eliminated the extra holes that were provided to wire up signals
and replaces them with silkscreen labels for the Arduino signals.

<li>All of the resistors are moved to the edge of the board, making it
easy to hook up potentiometers to figure out the brightness settings
for each channel</li>

<li>All ICs and resistors are labeled with the color channel they
control.</li>

<li>ERRATA: Vled and Vcc are labeled backwards on JP11.  Since you 
usually just connect these together, there's no real problem, but 
if you want to power the LEDs using a separate voltage source, connect
to the proper pin.</li>

<li>ERRATA: The GSCLK and BLANK labels are reversed on the
Arduino shield connector.  The labels on the piggyback connector,
JP21, are correct.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Version 1.3</h2>

<p>This is the same as version 1.4, but with a bug that reversed two
of the headers.  This bug actually was in boards going back to 1.0,
but it didn't matter before because the control signals were routed
externally.  The 1.3 boards can be used with alternative form-factor
Arduino boards where you wire on a breadboard, but they can't plug
into an Arduino board as a shield.</p>

<p>To wire this to an Arduino board, here's the wiring pattern you need:</p>

<ul>
<li>D3 on Arduino goes to D11/SOUT on shield.
<li>D9 on Arduino goes to D1/TX on shield.
<li>D10 on Arduino goes to D2/SW1 on shield
<li>D11 on Arduino goes to D3/GSCLK on shield
<li>D13 on Arduino goes to D5 on shield
<li>GND on Arduino goes to GND pin on shield (the one next to +5V)
<li>+5V on Arduino goes to +5V on shield
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.2</h2>

<p>This is a revised version of the 1.1 board with several changes we
discovered while assembling and using that version.  It never went
into production.</p>

<hr/>

<h2>Version 1.1</h2>

<p>This board was produced in a limited run by Seeed Studio as part of
their Propaganda program.  I documented the build-out process with
several YouTube videos and some posts
on <a href="http://unwiredben.livejournal.com/tag/rgg+led+shield">The
Life Unwired</a>.</p>
